        <b> Happy Valley Shelter</b> has been finding safe and loving homes for
        dogs in the Piedmont area since 1989. We work in cooperation with local
        county shelters and rescue organizations and specialize in caring for
        neglected and abandoned dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> At Happy Valley</b>, our staff are trained in all aspects of animal
        welfare and can give you expert advice on adoption, training, and care.
        We are proud of the work we do at Happy Valley and are grateful to our
        community for their support in helping us achieve our mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> We take great care</b> in matching each dog with the right family to
        ensure a successful adoption. We believe that every dog deserves a
        loving home, and we work tirelessly to make that a reality.
